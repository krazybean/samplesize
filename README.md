# SampleSize


Needed a quick implementation of Sample size formulation in code format,
I didn't see many other options provided (or maybe I didn't look hard enough)

So I derived one from [FluidSurvey's](http://fluidsurveys.com/university/calculating-right-survey-sample-size/) modified implementation.
